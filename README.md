CUNom
=====

(Databases Project with Sophie)

Description: CUNom is a disruptive web application to help students survive the perils of college life. Too often college students starve due to the cost of quality food around campus, when in fact free food events happen for nearly every meal of the day everyday. CUNom presents aggregated information about free food events on campus through an easy to use search interface. Users can go to the website and search for free food by keywords, tags, and date, as well as create an account to receive email notifications about upcoming free food. Here the events info will be taken from the Events Table (with attributes for Date, Location, id) and Events will have associated Tags (with attributes e\_id, name).  We hope to build the implement the front-end option and create the website using the light-weight Python framework Flask built on top of a MySQL database.

Database Schema: We will have tables for Users, Emails, SecurityQuestions, Events, Tags. An initial entity/relationship diagram is seen below.

Data Source: We will scrape the popular Columbia blog BWOG for most of our information on free food events. Information on users and their preferences will be populated through user input either during signup or through a preferences panel on the website.
